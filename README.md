## 📂 How It Works

1. **Display Menu** with 6 options (Add, View, Search, Update, Delete, Exit)  
2. **User Input** determines the action  
3. **Contacts stored in a dictionary** with names as keys and phone/email as values  
4. **Loop continues** until the user selects Exit

## 📊 Workflow

1. Initialize an empty dictionary `contacts`  
2. Define functions for:
   - `add_contact()`
   - `view_contacts()`
   - `search_contact()`
   - `update_contact()`
   - `delete_contact()`
3. Use a **while loop** for continuous menu display  
4. Perform actions based on user choice
